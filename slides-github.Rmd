# Goals for Today

* Discuss git and GitHub.

* Go over the GitHub + RStudio workflow.
    + For solo projects
    + For group projects

* Workshop simulation ideas.

([This slide deck](https://harvard-stat98.github.io/materials/slides-github.html#1) and the [Rmd](https://github.com/harvard-stat98/materials/blob/master/slides-github.Rmd) that generated the slide deck can be found [here](https://github.com/harvard-stat98/materials).)

## git and GitHub

* **git**: Version control system
    + Think fancier type of *Track Changes*.

* **GitHub**: Hosting service for git projects (which are called repositories)
    + Think fancier type of *DropBox*.

* Useful resource when getting started: [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/)

]

## Git Real

* Git is a *decentralized* version control system.
    + Each collaborator has a complete version of the repo.
    + Everyone can work offline and simultaneously.
    + GitHub holds the master copy.

* git is not friendly and can be frustrating.
      + BUT, the version control and collaborative rewards are big!
      
* [GitHub.com](GitHub.com) is a great place to develop an online presence.
    + In Stat 98, we will default to keeping the work private.

* If you end up with a mess of errors, then don't worry but come see one of the instructors for help.
    + It happens to [everyone](https://xkcd.com/1597/).


---

## Github Repo = `RStudio` Project

* A **repo**, short for repository, is the folder that contains all of the files for the project on [GitHub.com](GitHub.com).
 
* Under the **harvard-stat98** GitHub Organization you currently have 2 repos:
    + `username`: Just you (and instructors)
    + `sim-study-grpXXX`: You and your Assignment 2 partner

* For each repo, you should create an `RStudio` Project (with version control).
    + We will all do this together in a moment.
    


---

## Steps to Get Started


**Once-Per-Computer:**

* Install git on your computer.

* Get your local git talking to GitHub.

**Once-Per-Project:**

* Create a repo on GitHub. 
    + I did this step for us.

* Create a version controlled RStudio Project that is synced with the GitHub repo.

---

## Now:


* Sign-in to GitHub.com.

* Open a session in your local RStudio.

* Let's **git** our RStudio synced with our GitHub account and then make a change to our personal repo!
    + Make sure you accepted the repo request sent to your email.



---

## Check if git is install 

In **Terminal**, type

```{r, eval = FALSE}
which git
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
git --version
```

* If you receive an answer, then git is already install! `r emo::ji("tada")`

* If the reply is `git: command not found` (or similar), then
    + Windows: Visit [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    + Macs: In the Terminal type

```{r, eval = FALSE}    
xcode-select --install    
```

* If you had to install git, restart your RStudio Session.

---

## Introduce Yourself to Git 

* Install the package `usethis`.

* In your R console, modify and run the following code to introduce yourself to git

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "mcconvil", 
               user.email = "kmcconville@fas.harvard.edu")
```



---

## Personal Access Token Time

* Each time you interact with GitHub, you need to include credentials.
    + Personal Access Token (PAT)

* In your R console, run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::create_github_token()
```

* Should take you to GitHub.  

* Select "repo", "user", and "workflow" for the scopes.

* Click "Generate token".

* Copy the PAT to your clipboard and store it by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

* Also store it somewhere safe!

---

## Sync GitHub.com repo and an RStudio Project

**In your repo on GitHub.com**:

* Click on the green clone or download button.
* Copy the given url for "Clone with HTTPS".

**In RStudio**:

* In the upper left, go to File > New Project > Version Control.
* Select Git.
* Paste in the url.  It should automatically give it a name. Select where you want the project to live in your home directory. Then click okay.






---

## Workflow

Once your GitHub repo and RStudio project are synced, here's your workflow:

* **Pull** the most recent version of the repo from GitHub to your RStudio project.

* Do some work on your project in RStudio.

* **Commit** that work.
    + Committing takes a snapshot of all the files in the project.
    + Look over the **Diff**: which shows what has changed since your last update.
    + Include a quick note, **Commit Message** to summarize the motivation for the changes.


* **Push** your commit to GitHub from RStudio.

## Workflow Demo



---


## Ignoring Files

* There are several files that we want to **NOT** push to GitHub.

* These include:
    + `.gitignore`
    + `.DS_Store`

* Add these files to the `.gitignore`.    


---

## Test the waters: Let's go through the workflow.

* Pull. (Yes, there is nothing to pull yet but it is always good practice to start here.)
* Click on the ReadMe.
* Add something to the ReadMe.
* Click on the git tab.  Check the box next to the ReadMe.md. Hit commit.
* Put in a commit message.  Look over the diff.  
* Push.


**Look for updates in the ReadMe on GitHub.com.**


---

## Git Collaboration: Merge conflicts

* What if my partners and I both make changes? 
    + Scenario: Your partner makes changes to a file, commits, and pushes to GitHub. You also modify that file, commit and push.  
    + Result: Your push will fail because there's a commit on GitHub that you don't have.  
    + Usual Solution: Pull and *usually* git will merge their work nicely with yours.  Then push.  If that doesn't work, you have a **merge conflict**.  Let's cross that bridge when we get there.  
    
* How to avoid merge conflicts?
    + Always pull when you are going to work on your project.
    + Always commit and push when you are done even if you made small changes.


---

## Collaboration: Git Style

* **Projects**: Can use to create to do lists and stay organized.

* **Issues**: Useful method to communicate with your group members.

## Now we will walk around the room and help folks who had trouble with any of these steps.

### If you didn't have any issues, look through the items in your group repo.
