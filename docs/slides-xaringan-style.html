## Why Learn `xaringan`?


`xaringan` is good to use if:


+ Want to ensure you are using a reproducible workflow.

## `xaringan` Demystified

 Slides edited in an R Markdown document. 

--


Knits to HTML.

--

**If you have worked with an R Markdown document before, you can create `xaringan` slides!**

---

## How do I create slides?

.pull-left[

- First slides starts where the YAML (header stuff) ends

- `---` = New Slide



]

.pull-right[

```
---
output: xaringan::moon_reader 
---

# Header on Slide 1

Some stuff

---

# Header for Slide 2 

More stuff

```
]

## `xaringan` Tips!

The default resolution for figures is not high enough.

- Chunk option: `fig.retina = 1`



```r
# Isabelle's histogram of the inventory date 
count(get_pdxTrees_parks(), Inventory_Date) %&gt;%  
  ggplot(aes(x = Inventory_Date)) +   
  geom_histogram() 
```

## References

* To add in citations:


```r
library(RefManageR)
BibOptions(
  check.entries = FALSE, 
  bib.style = "authoryear", 
  cite.style = "authoryear", 
  style = "markdown",
  hyperlink = FALSE, 
  dashed = FALSE)
bibfile &lt;- ReadBib("xaringan.bib")
```

* For inline citations:
  + Using `Citet()`: Xie (2020)
  + Using `Citep()`: (Xie, 2020)
  + Using `NoCite()`:

## General Slide Creation Tips

--

* Creating good slides does take .bright-orange[effort] and should include .bright-orange[revisions].

--

* Use a 🖼 or 📊 over text whenever possible.

--

* Know your audience.

# .white[Questions?]

## .white[Shift to Coding Style]

---

## Write Readable Code

* It is important to write readable code.
    + Follow a specific convention.
    + Use spaces liberally.  
    + Avoid . in object names.
    
* Go through the Tidyverse [Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

* A similar style guide: [Google's Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml).

* As a group, decide on a style convention.  We don't want to see three or four different conventions for a given project.

---


## Write Readable Code

&gt; "Use common sense and BE CONSISTENT.


&gt; If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If others use spaces around their if clauses, you should, too. If their comments have little boxes of stars around them, make your comments have little boxes of stars around them, too.


&gt; The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying, rather than on how you are saying it. 


&gt; We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity will throw readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try to avoid this." --Google Style Guide
